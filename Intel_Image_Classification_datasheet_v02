# Datasheet Template

As far as you can, complete the model datasheet. If you have got the data from the internet, you may not have all the information you need, but make sure you include all the information you do have. 

## Motivation
Purpose: The dataset was created to facilitate image recognition tasks within the context of natural scenes around the world, aiming to challenge and improve the accuracy of neural network models in classifying diverse environmental settings.
Creators and Funders: The dataset was published by Intel on Analytics Vidhya's DataHack platform to host an Image Classification Challenge, indicating that Intel is the primary creator and funder of the dataset.

## Composition
Instances: This dataset includes around 25,000 images of size 150x150 pixels, distributed under 6 categories, which are encoded as follows: {'buildings' -> 0, 'forest' -> 1, 'glacier' -> 2, 'mountain' -> 3, 'sea' -> 4, 'street' -> 5}.
Volume: The dataset is divided into three parts: approximately 14,000 images in the training set, 3,000 in the test set, and 7,000 in the prediction set.
Missing Data: There is no explicit mention of missing data, suggesting the dataset is complete for each category.
Confidentiality: Given the dataset comprises images of natural scenes and urban environments, it is unlikely to contain confidential information.

## Collection Process
Acquisition: The images were collected to represent various natural scenes around the world. Specific details on the collection process are not provided, but it involves a wide array of scenes fitting into the six categories.
Sampling Strategy: The dataset is structured to include a balanced representation across the six defined categories, supporting unbiased model training.
Time Frame: The exact timeframe of the data collection is not specified. However, the publication date on Analytics Vidhya could provide some context regarding its recency.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling
Preprocessing: The images have been resized to 150x150 pixels and categorized under the six labels. The details on additional preprocessing steps, such as normalization or augmentation, are not provided.
Raw Data: There's no information on whether the raw, unprocessed images are available alongside the preprocessed dataset.

## Uses
Potential Uses: The dataset is primarily intended for building and benchmarking neural network models capable of classifying images into the six categories. It could also be used for tasks like feature extraction, transfer learning, and exploring model robustness in varied environmental conditions.
Impacts and Mitigation: Given the dataset's specific focus, users should consider supplementing it with additional data for applications beyond the included categories to avoid bias. The dataset’s balanced nature across categories should help mitigate risks of unfair treatment or stereotyping in model training.
Restrictions: The dataset is aimed at educational, research, and challenge purposes. Users should ensure their use complies with any terms of use provided by Intel or Analytics Vidhya, especially regarding commercial use or redistribution.

## Distribution
Distribution: The dataset has been distributed via Analytics Vidhya's DataHack platform for an image classification challenge. Intel provided the dataset, acknowledging its role in supporting AI education and research.
Copyright/IP/ToU: Detailed terms of use or copyright information specific to this dataset are not mentioned. Interested users should refer to Analytics Vidhya's and Intel’s policies or directly contact them for clarification.

## Maintenance
Maintainer: The dataset is likely maintained by Intel, with distribution facilitated through Analytics Vidhya for the challenge. Any updates or corrections to the dataset would presumably be managed by Intel or the hosting platform.
